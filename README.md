# Contributing to the Constitution

This may seem a bit daunting at first, but don't worry. This process is set out to make it extremely clear what is happenning and to maintain transparency for future and current members.

If you notice a problem with the constitution, or want to add something to it, click on the issues tab above and add a new issue. Include as much of the following as possible:

* What the change is
* Assign one of the three labels depending on what your issue is - Major for changes to the actual meaning, and Minor for spelling/grammar/clarity changes. Question should be used if you don't want to actually change the constitution.
* The benefits of the change
* Any negatives to the change
* Which other members/exec are supportive of the change, if any
* A brief overview of how the actual text needs to be changed.

Discussion will then happen on the issue. You can talk to other members and debate the changes. Once sufficient discussion has happened, Steven will create a new branch for your change, edit the constitution, and create a pull request which references the issue. Debate on the actual wording of the change will happen on that pull request.

Once the wording has been agreed on, the change will be debated at the next general meeting. If it is accepted, the pull request will be accepted. Otherwise, it will stay open so that it can continue to be modified until it is accepted.

Again, the last bit seems pretty complex but is very simple when you see it in action. So go ahead and add an issue and get started!
